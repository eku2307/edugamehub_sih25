### EduGameHub — SIH 2025 Project ###

A gamified learning platform transforming education through interactive challenges, progress tracking, and personalized learning journeys.



## ⭐ Overview

EduGameHub is an interactive learning ecosystem designed for students, teachers, and institutions.
Instead of passive textbook-based learning, the platform turns concepts into mini-games, challenges, quizzes, and real-time progress systems, making learning fun, visual, and addictive.

The aim is simple:
Make learning as engaging as gaming — without compromising educational depth.
